-- 15. Write a PL/SQL Block to create a PL/SQL table which can store grade and on of employees
-- with that grade. Get the information about the grade and number of employees with that
-- grade and store it in the PL/SQL table. Then retrieve the information from the PL/SQL table
-- and display it on the screen in the following way.
-- No of employees with the grade 1 are 3
-- No of employees with the grade 2 are 2
-- No of employees with the grade 3 are 1
-- No of employees with the grade 4 are 2
-- No of employees with the grade 5 are 5
